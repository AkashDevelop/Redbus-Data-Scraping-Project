This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to web scraping, data storage, and real-time data visualization using Selenium, SQL, and Streamlit. Focusing on bus information from [Redbus](https://www.redbus.in/), a popular online bus ticketing platform, this project extracts route and bus details, stores them in a structured database, and provides a user-friendly interface for dynamic data filtering.

# Project Goals
 Automated Data Extraction: Using Selenium, we scrape data across multiple routes for a range of buses. Key details collected include bus names, types, departure times, seat availability, prices, ratings, and other route information.
 
Data Storage: Data is stored in a SQL database, enabling structured querying and easy retrieval of information.

Interactive Filtering Interface: A Streamlit application allows users to filter the data based on bus type, star ratings, prices, and more. This dynamic filtering approach helps users find specific buses that match their preferences.
